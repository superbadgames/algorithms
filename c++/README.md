# Purpose

I am working on learning basic, fundamental computer science algorithms. I want to implement them in c++ because I like c++. I am going to record some decisions here, so that I document why I am doing some things.

## Conventions

### Namespacing

I am not going to worry about any namespaces until I need to. If I find that there is a problem caused by collisions, I'll add namespaces later.

This project is largely ad hoc, from many different sources, and is about experimentation, so I'm going to get weird with a few things. This is not meant to be production level code in all instances.
